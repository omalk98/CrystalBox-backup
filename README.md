# Project Crystal Box

This project aims to create a fully-fledged attendance system using hardware technology including Raspberry Pi, RFID Reader, lights, buzzers & NFC. We interact with the system (Rasp Pi) using an RFID reader or NFC-enabled mobile with an app and showing user details (name, email, UUID, security clearance levels, role, history of their movements in the system). Only registered users can enter the system. When they get approved by either the RFID reader or the NFC technology, a light will flash and a buzzer will beep. The project also has a web portal where we will have role-based (admins or users) authentication process and CRUD operations for managing users in the system.

For the mobile app we will be using React Native. For the Admin monitoring portal, we will be using React.js as its frontend, Node.js as its backend & MongoDB for the data persistence. As for the hardware, installed on Raspberry Pi, namely, RFID Reader, lights, buzzers, and NFC can be controlled via Node.js in JavaScript.
