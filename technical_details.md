# Back-End

The backend service is hosted on a [Heroku](https://heroku.com) cloud machine. It uses a Node.js framework which in turn uses Express.js package that introduces MVC pattern to implement the Separation of Concerns (SOC) principle to separate the models, views & controllers from each other to provide code reusability and maintainability. It uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) behind the scenes to persist all the user data which is transferred to the user using HTTPS protocol.

# Front-End

The front-end of the admin portal will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) as its frontend framework and [Bootstrap 5.0](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) as its UI framework. React uses Virtual DOM to update the underlying DOM elements, which provides faster webpage load time. As for the Mobile application it will use React Native as its frontend framework and [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) as its UI framework.

# Developing Tools

This system was developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using JavaScript, Python, and C++, using JavaScript for the server and frontend, Python for [RFID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification) interactions, and C++ for handling hardware modules.
