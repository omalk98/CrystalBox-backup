### Project Chart

#### Introduction (7.5/7.5)*2/3
Add more details about the system -> Done (grade bumped)
- Which settings will this system be applied to
- Make sure to let users know that it can be used for both controlling access, as well as recording that the user is present (attendance)

- 
Extended to the end of the day (Wednesday)

### Overview (7.5/7.5)*2/3
 Perfect!
 
 
 ### Technical Details (15/15)*2/3
 Very well done. I would add Express to your list of back-end frameworks.
 
 ## Task 3
 
 ### Use cases
 
- **Create New User (done by Philippe)** - Well done! The alternate flows are incomplete. They describe the errors made by the user, but not the responses from the system. 8/10
- **Premise Access (done by Soham)** - Well done! Shouldn't the user access be logged into the system? I missed that step in the main flow and on the post-conditons. There should be an alternate flow covering the case were a user has an RFID that is not working properly. 7/10
- **Reissue RFID Key (done by Omar)** - Perfect 10/10

### Milestones (4.5/5.0)
- Milestones are tailored for the dev team. You should avoid terms such as published or fully implemented and use "designed and tested" for example.
- Second part of item 5 should be a deliverable
- Items 7 and 8 shoudl be rewritten as per my first note

### Deliverables (4.0/5.0)
- For item 4, there should be a reason (taking the client's perspective) for this connection
- Items 5 and 6 are missing: "up and running" or "published"

## Task 4

### Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints (5/5)
Perfect!

### README.md (5/5)
No changes requested

### Use Cases
- **Create new Admin (done by Soham)** - Almost Perfect! (10/10) Your postconditions should also indicate the changes in the database.
- **First User Login (done by Philippe)** - Almost Perfect (10/10) The case where the new password and confirmation passsword do not match should have been an alternate case on its own.
- **Viewing System Activity (done by Omar)** - PErfect (10/10)
