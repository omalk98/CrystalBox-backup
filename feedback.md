 ## Task 3
 
 ### Use cases
 
- **Create New User (done by Philippe)** - Well done! The alternate flows are incomplete. They describe the errors made by the user, but not the responses from the system. 8/10
- **Premise Access (done by Soham)** - Well done! Shouldn't the user access be logged into the system? I missed that step in the main flow and on the post-conditons. There should be an alternate flow covering the case were a user has an RFID that is not working properly. 7/10
- **Reissue RFID Key (done by Omar)** - Perfect 10/10
