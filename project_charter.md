# Project Crystal Box

## 1. Introduction

Our project aims to elevate the concept of a simple attendance system and add a layer of security to the system which can be utilized in more secure environments. The system will use two main access methods to a location such as a school, event, or work environment, using Bluetooth and RFID chips as a secure access point where the user must present valid credentials (admin issued UUID) to be able to enter. Both RFID & BT gateways will share the UUID generated for each user when they are added to the system. When the user attempts to access the system, it will firstly check against the user's credentials before recording them to the database to mark them for attendance. The system will provide multi level access using user-roles as a security measure against accessing certain rooms/areas, allowing the admin to control which users have access to those rooms/areas.
