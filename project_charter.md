# Project Crystal Box

## 1. Introduction

Our project aims to elevate the concept of a simple attendance system and add multiple methods to access a location, as well as keep track of users who enter through the RFID/Bluetooth gateway and have multiple levels of clearance to enter certain areas. This adds a layer of security to the system which can be utilized in more secure environments.
